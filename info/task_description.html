<!-- Describe task in general -->

<p>I want to know when I will celebrate my birthday.</p>

<p>The only problem is that often I can't organize a party on the same day as my birthday, because I want to invite a lot of my friends and the most convenient day for them to celebrate is the weekend.</p>

<p>I was hoping you could help me calculate the party date by the given birthday date, but, as I said before, the date should meet specific requirements:</p>

<ul>
    <li>It should always be the closes weekend to my birthday.</li>
    <li>I don't want to celebrate before the birthday.</li>
    <li>But I'm ok with marking in the day.</li>
</ul>



<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Date of my birthday.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> Date of the party.
</p>
